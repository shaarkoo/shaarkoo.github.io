introduction: 
    header: What is Tapenade?
    body: >
        Tapenade is a dip, spread, or condiment that usually consists of pureed olives, capers, and anchoives. It orginated from France and Mackenzie and I really love it with some freshly toasted bread and a nice glass of white wine. Our take on a classic tapenade does not use anchovies or capers and it is pretty quick to throw together!

      tip: Fresh garlic and parsley really make a difference here and should be used over dried spices.

        Sometimes you just need to buy the fresh ingredients and this is one of those times. Finely chopped fresh garlic just adds the extra ounce of flavor this dish needs to be truly fantastic. Fresh parsley is flavorful and brings a wonderful aroma to the dip that just cannot be beat by dried spices. It also adds a deep green color that, in my opinion, compliments the red from the olives and the white from the garlic!

      tip: For a finer tapenade, pulse the processor more times to reach the consistency you want.

        I love using my handheld processor, <a href="https://amzn.to/3jIGWZG">Cuisinart Hand Blender</a>, it is quick and easy to especially for this recipe. I know not everyone has one and it truly is not required to create this dish. Just take your time and mince the olives, garlic, and parsely. Combine those ingredients into a servicing bowl and then move on to adding the oil, vinegar, and salt!
